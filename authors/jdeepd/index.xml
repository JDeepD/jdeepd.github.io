      <description>Urn A contains 6 red and 4 black balls. Urn B contains 4 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from Urn A and placed in Urn B. Then, one ball is drawn at random from Urn B and placed in Urn A. Now, If one ball is drawn from Urn A, find the probability that it is red. (Cengage JEE Adv Algebra, 3e)
 The question is straight forward.</description>

      <description>git bisect    Ever faced a situation where you made multiple commits to your project only to break a feature which you are sure it worked properly before you went on the commit spree?
How on earth do you even plan to begin debugging the code in such a scenario?
One could go on a brute force approach but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be much easier(to debug) if git just tells you which commit messed up your feature?</description>
