      <description>git bisect    Ever faced a situation where you made multiple commits to your project only to break a feature which you are sure it worked properly before you went on the commit spree?
How on earth do you even plan to begin debugging the code in such a scenario?
One could go on a brute force approach but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be much easier(to debug) if git just tells you which commit messed up your feature?</description>
