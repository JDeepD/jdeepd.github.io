      <description>Urn A contains 6 red and 4 black balls. Urn B contains 4 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from Urn A and placed in Urn B. Then, one ball is drawn at random from Urn B and placed in Urn A. Now, If one ball is drawn from Urn A, find the probability that it is red. (Cengage JEE Adv Algebra, 3e)
