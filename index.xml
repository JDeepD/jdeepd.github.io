      <description>Urn A contains 6 red and 4 black balls. Urn B contains 4 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from Urn A and placed in Urn B. Then, one ball is drawn at random from Urn B and placed in Urn A. Now, If one ball is drawn from Urn A, find the probability that it is red. (Cengage JEE Adv Algebra, 3e)
 The question is straight forward.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Notes can have errors. Mail me if you find some.     Few points to remember:
 Array indexing in C A trivial note about %s placeholder You cant actually pass an array to a function in C   Consider this code:
int main(int argc, char** argv) { return 0; } &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ./test in1 in2 Here,
