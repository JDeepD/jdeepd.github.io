      <description>So this week, I dived into the codebase of ref-filters.c and for builtins/for-each-ref.c. In this blog, I will try to give a brief overview of those.
Before that, you should know what Git References or simply, refs are.
git for-each-ref is a simple command for listing out all(or maybe some) of the refs in a repository in a specific format. For ex, you want to print out the refs inside .</description>

      <description>So, My proposal to the org git got accepted for GSoC 2022. For the next few days, I will be exploring the codebase, also try to make some side contributions under the mentorship of Christian and Hariom. I am already in contact with them regarding the proposal.
Till now, I have read most the &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; docs in Hacking Git. Yesterday, I was reading this very interesting tutorial on Write yourself a Git.</description>

      <description>Suppose you are given a situation where you have to produce some output which depends on various arguments(flags) that the user provides.
For ex, lets say you are given a number and you are asked to do some tests on it:
 Is the number postive? Is the magnitude(number) odd? Is the magnitude(number) prime?  You are also asked to save all the test results in memory so that you can pass it to other functions if required.</description>

      <title>A tour of my workflow</title>

      <description>My main workflow consists of multiple browser tabs, kitty and a tmux session along with neovim. All of them are customised to my liking ofcourse(although kitty is just pretty in default)
For browser, I primarily use Chrome(don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why. Its just that all my accounts get instant login there.) I use the vimium extension and Adblock extension Both of them work out of the box with no configuration required.</description>

      <description>Urn A contains 6 red and 4 black balls. Urn B contains 4 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from Urn A and placed in Urn B. Then, one ball is drawn at random from Urn B and placed in Urn A. Now, If one ball is drawn from Urn A, find the probability that it is red. (Cengage JEE Adv Algebra, 3e)
 The question is straight forward.</description>

      <description>git bisect    Ever faced a situation where you made multiple commits to your project only to break a feature which you are sure it worked properly before you went on the commit spree?
How on earth do you even plan to begin debugging the code in such a scenario?
One could go on a brute force approach but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be much easier(to debug) if git just tells you which commit messed up your feature?</description>
